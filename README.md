# dubins

The dubins library is a C++ implementation of Dubins' paths, using C++17 standard. It offers extra features as openCV visualization (this is why you should install our demlo2d package first), and a vector type suitable for vq3 computation.

# Support

dubins is a result of the <a href="http://interreg-grone.eu">GRONE project</a>, supported by the Interreg "Grande RÃ©gion" program of the European Union's European Regional Development Fund.
